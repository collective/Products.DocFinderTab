DocFinderTab 1.0.2

This product ows nearly everything to Dieter Maurer's DocFinder
product (version 1.0.3).

I just put some sugar on it ;-)

To install extract the tarball into your Products directory and
restart Zope. This will add a "Doc" tab to every object's managment
screens. Now go to an object's management screen, click the "Doc"
tab and start exploring.

See the online help for a detailed explanation of what you can
do with DocFinderTab (or read help/README.txt).
